# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Emi Jr. Anyakpor**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/mousy-tattered-camel?path=script.js%3A1%3A0)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used stack overflow for more information about how the compiler reads javaScript. This helped me solve a problem I was having. Lastly, I used codePath's resources to make sure I was in the right track.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[One overall challenge for me was getting used to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've worked with java and kotlin but using three languages to complete one project felt so different for me. Having to code my logic in JavaScript and code the design in CSS, finally coding the structure of my webpage in HTML was extremely confusing. Mainly because ide’s like Visual Studio and Android Studio all categorize it for you while needing only one language to code. Another challenge was trying to understand how the compiler reads the code. In C++ we use an ide called Visual Studio and can easily debug the program. I read the guide and saw how the console.log was similar to a print statement. This helped me debug and solve problems in my code. Lastly, the issue that got me stuck the most was figuring out why the start/stop button wasn’t switching. I found out there was code at the top of the javascript file that shouldn’t be there. I deleted it and everything was fine. Although the solution is simple I was racking my brain for an hour trying to figure out why I was having problems. Through my persistence and wanting to find the solution I figured out what the issue was.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[When writing in the javascript file does the compiler read the code from top to bottom? Using web development is interesting but I wonder if theres a way to block people from seeing your projects. Unlike using ide’s to build big projects. I’m building a website where if anyone has the URL they can access it. I wonder if there are preventive measures in preventing someone even with the URL from opening the website. Maybe similar to a password. I wonder if it's difficult to publish a website on the internet. I know wix.com is one way for people to publish their websites. I ask this question because android apps you must pay to publish an app on the play store. Hopefully, I get to answers these questions as I move on from the prework to the internship.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I think a cool idea would be changing the gameButtonAreas to be an image of animals. So maybe if it's possible I would download .mP4 of four animal sounds so you would know what the button to press by the animal sound. I like this idea because when I was playing this game. it got frustrating how focused I had to be to listen to the sounds to know which one to click, even though I knew the pattern. Another idea I would add to the project is to have more game buttons. These buttons would match the note on a piano C D E F G A B. I’m learning to play so implementing these notes could produce a song! One song I have in mind is “When the Saints go Marching in”. I would implement this in javascript since thats where all the logic is. I’d definitely use StackOverflow to figure out how I can import some .mp4 sounds into the site glitch. Adding a function that can take in .mp4 sounds and remove the default game sounds.  Something important to me about coding is the wonders you can do with it and make it unique to you. For example, I love animals and music so these ideas sound great to me!
